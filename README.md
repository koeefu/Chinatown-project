# Chinatown-project
I’m super into Chinatown. I guess it’s because I’m from northern China, and Chinatown is more like southern Chinese culture. Sometimes I just feel surreal there. I’m kind of familiar with the culture here, but not that familiar. 

Actually, one person could spend their entire life only in this neighborhood without ever stepping foot outside of it. Within Chinatown, there are so many different facets of life to explore, from the maternity hospitals and Buddhist associations to the tombstone shops that cater to a person's entire life cycle.

I plan to create a set of architectural structures arranged in a ring shape, symbolizing the cyclical nature of life. 

And texts in Chinatown really have a unique style. To reflect this, the names of these structures will be generated based on information I collected from Chinatown.
